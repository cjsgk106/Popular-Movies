# Popular-Movies

This is my project for Developing an Android Mobile Application "Popular Movies" part 1 from Android Developer Nanodegree Program. This application shows popular movies. Part 2 project will upgrade it more.

# Feature

With this app, you can
- Find out what kinds of movies are up recently.
- Discover specific details about the movies, such as released date, rate, and description.
# How to use this source
Since this application uses The Movie DataBase API, you need to get your own API key to launch the application. Change the String variable, API_KEY once you obtain the API key.

# Libraries
- [picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) - for loading and caching images
